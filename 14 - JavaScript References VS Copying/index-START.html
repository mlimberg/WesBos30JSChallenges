  <script>
    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let string = 'hey'
    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    let copy1 = players

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    copy1[2] = 'Snoop';

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Snoop', 'Poppy']

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    let copy2 = players.slice();
    let copy2 = [].concat(players.slice());
    let copy2 = Array.from(players);
    let copy2 = [...players];

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    let person = {
      name: 'Bob',
      age: 33,
    }
    // with Objects
    let copyObj = person
    // and think we make a copy:
    copyObj.name = 'Jesse' will overwrite person
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    copyObj = Object.assign({}, person, { name: 'Jesse' })
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
